Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
FDUPES is a program for identifying duplicate files residing
within specified directories. 


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: fdupes [options] DIRECTORY...

 -r --recurse     	for every directory given follow subdirectories
                  	encountered within
 -R --recurse:    	for each directory given after this option follow
                  	subdirectories encountered within (note the ':' at
                  	the end of the option, manpage for more details)
 -s --symlinks    	follow symlinks
 -H --hardlinks   	normally, when two or more files point to the same
                  	disk area they are treated as non-duplicates; this
                  	option will change this behavior
 -n --noempty     	exclude zero-length files from consideration
 -A --nohidden    	exclude hidden files from consideration
 -f --omitfirst   	omit the first file in each set of matches
 -1 --sameline    	list each set of matches on a single line
 -S --size        	show size of duplicate files
 -m --summarize   	summarize dupe information
 -q --quiet       	hide progress indicator
 -d --delete      	prompt user for files to preserve and delete all
                  	others; important: under particular circumstances,
                  	data may be lost when using this option together
                  	with -s or --symlinks, or when specifying a
                  	particular directory more than once; refer to the
                  	fdupes documentation for additional information
 -N --noprompt    	together with --delete, preserve the first file in
                  	each set of duplicates and delete the rest without
                  	prompting the user
 -I --immediate   	delete duplicates as they are encountered, without
                  	grouping into sets; implies --noprompt
 -p --permissions 	don't consider files with different owner/group or
                  	permission bits as duplicates
 -o --order=BY    	select sort order for output and deleting; by file
                  	modification time (BY='time'; default), status
                  	change time (BY='ctime'), or filename (BY='name')
 -i --reverse     	reverse order while sorting
 -G --minsize=SIZE	consider only files greater then or equal to SIZE
 -L --maxsize=SIZE	consider only files of size less or equal to SIZE
 -v --version     	display fdupes version
 -h --help        	display this help message

Unless -1 or --sameline is specified, duplicate files are listed 
together in groups, each file displayed on a separate line. The
groups are then separated from each other by blank lines.

When -1 or --sameline is specified, spaces and backslash characters (\) 
appearing in a filename are preceded by a backslash character. For
instance, "with spaces" becomes "with\ spaces".

When using -d or --delete, care should be taken to insure against
accidental data loss. While no information will be immediately
lost, using this option together with -s or --symlink can lead 
to confusing information being presented to the user when prompted
for files to preserve. Specifically, a user could accidentally
preserve a symlink while deleting the file it points to. A similar
problem arises when specifying a particular directory more than 
once. All files within that directory will be listed as their own
duplicates, leading to data loss should a user preserve a file 
without its "duplicate" (the file itself!).
