Changes from 1.50 to 1.51

- Added support for 64-bit file offsets on 32-bit systems.
- Using tty for interactive input instead of regular stdin. This is to
  allow  feeding filenames via stdin in future versions of fdupes without
  breaking interactive deletion feature.
- Fixed some typos in --help.
- Turned C++ style comments into C style comments.

Changes from 1.40 to 1.50-PR2

- Fixed memory leak. [JB]
- Added "--summarize" option. [AL]
- Added "--recurse:" selective recursion option. [AL]
- Added "--noprompt" option for totally automated deletion of
  duplicate files.
- Now sorts duplicates (old to new) for consistent order when
  listing or deleteing duplicate files.
- Now tests for early matching of files, which should help speed up
  the matching process when large files are involved.
- Added warning whenever a file cannot be deleted. [CHL, AL]
- Fixed bug where some files would not be closed after failure. [AL]
- Fixed bug where confirmmatch() function wouldn't always deal
  properly with zero-length files. [AL]
- Fixed bug where progress indicator would not be cleared
  when no files were found. [AL]
- Removed experimental red-black tree code (it was slower on
  my system than the default code). [AL]
- Modified md5/md5.c to avoid compiler warning. [CHL]
- Changes to fdupes.c for compilation under platforms where
  getopt_long is unavailable. [LR, AL]

- Added escaping of filenames containing spaces when
  sameline option is specified. [AL]
- Changed version indicator format from "fdupes version X.Y"
  to the simpler "fdupes X.Y". [AL]
- Changed ordering of options appearing in the help
  text (--help), manpage, and README file. [AL]

Changes from 1.30 to 1.31

- Added interactive option to preserve all files during
  delete procedure (something similar was already in 
  place, but now it's official). [AL]

- Cosmetic code changes. [AL]

Changes from 1.20 to 1.30

- Added size option to display size of duplicates. [LB, AL]
- Added missing typecast for proper compilation under g++. [LB]
- Better handling of errors occurring during retrieval
  of a file's signature. [KK, AL]
- No longer displays an error message when specified
  directories contain no files. [AL]
- Added red-black tree structure (experimental compile-time
  option, disabled by default). [AL]

Changes from 1.12 to 1.20

- Fixed bug where program would crash when files being
  scanned were named pipes or sockets. [FD]
- Fix against security risk resulting from the use of a
  temporary file to store md5sum output. [FD, AL]
- Using an external md5sum program is now optional. Started 
  using L. Peter Deutsh's MD5 library instead. [FD, AL]
- Added hardlinks option to distinguish between hard links
  and actual duplicate files. [FD, AL]
- Added noempty option to exclude zero-length files
  from consideration [AL]

Changes from 1.11 to 1.12
