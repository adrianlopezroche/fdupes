Installing fdupes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To build and install the program, issue the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Starting with fdupes 2.0.0, a full-featured installation requires
the following libraries to be installed on your system:

  - ncursesw (ncurses with support for wide characters)
  - PCRE2 (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library)

Source code for these libraries is available at:

  https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/
  https://www.pcre.org/

If these libraries are not available on your system or you want to
build fdupes without them, you may instead call configure as:

	./configure --without-ncurses

followed by "make" and "sudo make install" as before.

Please note that compiling fdupes without these libraries will
disable the new screen-mode interface for choosing which files to
keep or delete. Without them, fdupes will use an interface like
the one used in previous versions.

The commands above will build and install fdupes and its
documentation under /usr/local by default. You may change the
install location using:

	./configure --prefix=/your/chosen/path

followed by "make" and "sudo make install" as before.

A test directory is included so that you may familiarise yourself
with the way fdupes operates. You may test the program before
installing it by issuing a command such as "./fdupes testdir"
or "./fdupes -r testdir", just to name a couple of examples. Refer
to the documentation for information on valid options.
